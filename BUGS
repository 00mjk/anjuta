  Issue : The command line filenames (regular files) aren't opened because
	  of the gnome_filelist widget, which use chdir () without backuping
	  its value. 
 
  Severity : Low 

  Why : The g_get_current_dir returns the false directory before opening the
        file (~fn if opening fn in /usr/share/doc for example). 
  
  Field of application : This just apply to relative pathname. 
  
  Solution : This widget should list the directory rather than chdir and
             list it.
