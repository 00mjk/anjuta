Notes for Developers on contributing to Anjuta
----------------------------------------------

(TO BE EXPANDED OVER TIME)


Tools
-----

IMPORTANT: please be careful about using Anjuta to develop Anjuta.
It is probably best not to use Anjuta for its own development,
as it may break lots of things while developing.


Source structure
----------------

When editing the code, adding new classes or methods, etc. please 
conform with the style already followed in the source files.

Key elements:
* src/ The main Anjuta sources
* scintilla/ The editor
* widgets/ Additional widgets used
* ccview/ The C++ class viewer


Documentation
-------------

The documentation is stored in the manuals/ directory, and consists 
of a set of SGML sources conforming to the GNOME Documentation Project's
Style Guide as far as possible.

Translations of application messages are stored in the standard po/ 
directory structure at the top level of the source tree.
