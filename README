Introduction:
-------------

Anjuta is a versatile Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for C and C++ 
on GNU/Linux. It has been written for GTK/GNOME, and features a number of 
advanced programming facilities. These include project management, 
application wizards, an on board interactive debugger, and a powerful source 
editor with source browsing and syntax highlighting.

Anjuta is an effort to marry the flexibility and power of text-based 
command-line tools with the ease-of-use of the GNOME graphical user 
interface. That is why it has been made as user-friendly as possible.

At present, Anjuta is only a beta release and lots of work needs to be done to 
improve it. In the future, Anjuta is going to be much more capable and stable! 
Extensive debugging has not yet been performed, so at the moment it will 
undoubtedly have lots of bugs. It would be great if you use it and report any 
problems to us. That way, you will be helping to improve the software as well 
as helping the Open Source community.

Any sort of suggestions or patches for Anjuta are also most welcome.
