Introduction:
-------------
This document is the roadmap for future development of anjuta.

The goal of Anjuta DevStudio is to provide a truely customizable and
extensible IDE framework and at the same time provide the basic implementations
of common development tools. libanjuta is the framework that realizes the
Anjuta IDE plugin framework and Anjuta DevStudio realizes many of the common
development plugins.

Anjuta branches:
----------------
Anjuta currently has two main branches, ANJUTA_1_2_0 and HEAD. The ANJUTA_1_2_0
branch is stable branch and corresponds to anjuta-1.x release series. The
HEAD branch is the anjuta-2.x releases and is the latest development series.

Anjuta 2.x development series has new extensible plugin architecture and all
the plugins have been ported to this new plateform. The libanjuta interface
defines all the IDE APIs and is used to write anjuta plugins. In addition, it
also provides many utility classes.
