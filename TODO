BUGS:
-----
1) Core dumps on three file imports in a sequence.

2) Gdb Mismatch with Mandrak 8 distribution. Process ID not properly
recognized with gdb v5.0.

3) In a C++ projects, checking for the gtkmm and gnomemm packages

4) For whatever reason db1-devel_1.85-4mdk was not installed by default and
ld gave me errors (can't find -ldb1). Checking for db1 depenency (both rpm and configure).
