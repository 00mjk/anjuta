Todo List:
----------
	o New files
	o Multiple file import
	o Comments in source files
	
	o Compiler options: supports
	o Different types of projects: executable/library/shared-library etc.
	o If any text is edited or changed in an open pane in the IDE, then the
	  filename on the tab at the top of that pane could change colour
	o Being able to open a source rpm (.src.rpm) or a .tgz tarball and have it
	  imported as a project

	o Debugger optimization
	o Gnome Print

	o Confirm root before program installation
	o Utilities
	o Integration with glade, gtranslator, eog and other bonobo components
	
	o Enabling/disabling calltips in preferences.
	o Double/single click open file in preferences.

	o Use GtkHTML if available to browse online documentation/manuals
	o easy (S)RPMS & Debian packages build
	  (assistant and/or edit the spec or debian dir)
	o embedding a zvt term

	o > When the windows are docked, and we resize the main window of Anjuta, 
	  > the docked window doesn't move with the resize.  As an example, I had

	  Well, that's a problem with the GtkPanedWindows, but I thing we make a
	  temporary work around fix in anjuta by capturing the resize signal of
	  the concerned widgets. Anybody care to have look in it? :-)

	  So, watch out guys! Atleast don't miss the beer. :-)

BUGS:
-----
1) Core dumps on three file imports in a sequence.

3) In a C++ projects, checking for the gtkmm and gnomemm packages

4) For whatever reason db1-devel_1.85-4mdk was not installed by default and
ld gave me errors (can't find -ldb1). Checking for db1 dependency (both rpm and configure).
