TODO List:
----------


** Immediate post-0.1.9:

	o new file widget
	o rewrite manual
	o improve find functionality
	o project manager changes
	

** General:

    o Comments in source files
	
	o Compiler options: supports
	o Being able to open a source rpm (.src.rpm) or a .tgz tarball and have it
	  imported as a project

	o Debugger optimization
	o Gnome Print

	o Utilities
	o Integration with glade, gtranslator, eog and other bonobo components
	
	o Enabling/disabling calltips in preferences.
	o Double/single click open file in preferences.

	o Use GtkHTML if available to browse online documentation/manuals
	o easy (S)RPMS & Debian packages build
	  (assistant and/or edit the spec or debian dir)
	o use PHP vars like C ones (with the tags bar); easy since they all
	  begin with $

	  Well, that's a problem with the GtkPanedWindows, but I thing we make a
	  temporary work around fix in anjuta by capturing the resize signal of
	  the concerned widgets. Anybody care to have look in it? :-)

BUGS:
-----
- For whatever reason db1-devel_1.85-4mdk was not installed by default and
ld gave me errors (can't find -ldb1). Checking for db1 dependency (both rpm and configure).

- Tooltips that pop up for a function (eg. "printf(") persist
onscreen when changing source files. 
This is now fixed but now calltips flicker if the curser touches
them.
