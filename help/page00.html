<h3><u>Introduction</u></h3>
Anjuta is a very versatile Integrated development environment for c and c++ (Gnu/Linux). 
Written in gtk/gnome and written for gtk/gnome, it features many advanced programming tools 
and utilities. It is basically a GUI interface for the bunch of command line programming utilities 
and tools available for Linux, which are usually run in console and are very un-user friendly.
The source code of the beta version is available for download at the home site <b>http://anjuta.sourceforge.net/<b>.
<P>
Anjuta is an effort to marry the flexibility and power of text
based command line tools with the ease of graphical user interface of gnome. That's why I have,
with all my might, made it as much as user friendly interface as possible. Please have a look at the
<a href="page01.html#scrnshot">screen-shot</a>.
<p>
Presently, Anjuta is only in Beta release and lots of work are to
be done to improve it. I hope in the 
future Anjuta is going to be much more 
capable and stable. Extensive debugging session has not yet been performed.
So, undoubtedly, it will have lots of bugs. It will be my pleasure if you use it and
<a href="page111.html#start>report the bugs</a> to me. That way, you will
be helping to improve the software as well as helping the open-source community.
<p>
Any sort of suggestions or 
patches for anjuta are also most welcome.
<P>
Remember, this program is a <B><U>FREEWARE</U></B> and not a shareware. 
Please read the <a href="page114.html#start>copyright</a> for details.
