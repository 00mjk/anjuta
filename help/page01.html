<h3><u>Getting familiar with the GUI.</u></h3>
<b><u>Menus:<u></u></u></b>

<p>The top most part of the Anjuta IDE is the menu bar. Almost all of the
functionalities are available by activating the appropriate menu item. The
functions have been grouped according to their type of operations. For
instance, most of the file and project operations have been grouped in the
sub-menu 'File'. Similarly, The other sub-menus contain the operations they
are grouped to.</p>

<p></p>

<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td align="left" NOSAVE><img src="menu_detached.jpg"></td>
      <td align="left" NOSAVE>The main menu is detachable. Drag it from the
        main window using the handle at the extreme right. Once it is
        detached, it will become a floating menu.

        <p>All the Sub-menus in the main menu are detachable. You can detach
        it by clicking the detach bar on the sub-menu (just above the first
        item). Once the sub-menu is detached, it will be shown as an
        independent window. A detached menu is shown as an illustration.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><b><u>Tool-bars:<u></u></u></b></p>

<p>To make the life easier, all those operations which are performed very
often are made available from the tool-bars. There are basically four
tool-bars on the main window. They are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Main tool-bar.</li>
  <li>Extended tool-bar.</li>
  <li>Browser tool-bar.</li>
  <li>Debug tool-bar.</li>
</ol>

<p>It would be worth spending some time getting familiar with the tool-bar
buttons. Tool tips describing the function of the tool-bar buttons will appear
as soon as you move the mouse over the buttons. Read and remember them
carefully. Tool-bars avoid the unnecessary selection of menu items which are
used very often.</p>

<p>You will find some combo (entry) boxes on the tool-bars. They are explained
in the later section.</p>

<p>Similarly, to make the life still more easier, short cuts are available for
those operations that are performed very often. All the keyboard short cuts
are given along with their corresponding menu item. You must remember some of
them, for they become handy while you are typing into the editor and you don't
want to leave the keyboard. <a name="scrnshot"></a></p>

<p><b><u>Main Window:<u></u></u></b></p>

<p><img src="scrshot.jpg"></p>

<p>In the main window, there are three frames that you must be familiar with,
before you start doing anything (All of them may not be visible when you start
Anjuta). They are called:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Editor window.</li>
  <li>Project window.</li>
  <li>Message window.</li>
</ol>

<p>The frame on the left is the <b>Project window</b>, on the right is the
<b>Editor window</b> and the one at the bottom is the <b>Message window</b>.
The project window and the message window can be detached into separate
windows instead of docking them into the main window. You can detach them by
clicking the the detach button (You will find them along with the frames: the
small buttons with the un-docking icon). Similarly, you can hide them, by
clicking the hide buttons (small buttons with the red cross). You can make
them visible anytime by activating the menu items View/Project listing and
View/Message, respectively, or by clicking the corresponding tool-bar buttons
in the main tool-bar.</p>

<p></p>
<ol>
  <li><b><u>Editor window</u></b> is the part of the main window, so you can
    either detach nor hide it. But, you can always detach the individual
    documents, which are shown as pages in the editor window. Editor window
    will have one document active at a time (if there is any file opened). All
    the file commands are meant for this active document. You can switch to
    any page by clicking on the page tag. You can do the same by right
    clicking on the page tags and selecting the document from the pop up menu
    that will appear. This is especially useful when you have many files
    opened and all the files not visible in the page tag area.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><b><u>Project window</u></b> shows the project files if you have a
    project opened. Otherwise, the project window is usually hidden. Double
    clicking on any item in the project window will open that file.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="message_win"></a> <b><u>Message window</u></b> will list all
    the messages (both stdout and stderr outputs) when an external command is
    executed. Message window is usually hidden, but appears as soon as the
    external command is executed, such as during file or project compilation
    or building, during debugging session, searching in files and many other
    operations requiring external commands. Anjuta also adds its own messages
    whenever it becomes necessary.
    <p>The colors with which the messages are displayed in the message window
    are very important to note. Messages displayed in normal color (usually
    black) are normal messages. Those displayed in Blue are usually important
    messages such as error messages or some important information. Messages
    shown in Red color are <b>Hot linked</b>. That is double clicking on such
    a message will take you to the particular file and line number specified
    in the message.</p>
    <p>For example, when you compile a buggy file, some messages in red will
    appear in the message window which tell where is the error and what sort
    of error is that. Double clicking on such messages will open the file and
    hi-lite the line containing the error.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>All these three frames are realizable. Try adjusting them by dragging the
handle bars separating them.</p>

<p><b><u>Things to note:<u></u></u></b></p>

<p>One last thing I should tell you in this section is that, all the settings,
including all the window sizes and window positions, are saved when you exit
Anjuta  Then they are all set again when you next restart Anjuta  Session
management is still under development. So you should not exit Anjuta with any
unsaved document. Of course, Anjuta will display a warning if you try to exit
Anjuta with unsaved document(s) still opened.</p>
