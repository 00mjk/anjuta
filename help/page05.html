<h3><u>Browsing with tags:</u></h3>
All C and C++ source and header  files can be browsed using the tags in the files. 
All the currently opened C and C++ source and header files are scanned for the 
available tags (Tags are nothing but the function definitions, structures, defines etc). 
Select the type of the tag you want to view in the tag pull down menu in the browser 
tool-bar. If the tag type is function or class, you will have to further select the file for 
which you want to view the tag. Then select the tag (function, class member or the 
other tags) from the tag combo box. Then the editor will take you to that particular file 
and line and hi-lite the line that contains the tag.
<p>
<b><u>Following tags are recorded:<u></b><p>
<ul>
  <li> Functions
  <li> Classes
  <li> Structures
  <li> Unions
  <li> Enumerations
  <li> Variables [global]
  <li> Macros
</ul>
<p>
<b><u>File mode operation:<u></b><p>
If there is no project opened, then Anjuta is in <b>File mode</b>. In this mode, Anjuta keeps 
account of the opened file(s) only. Anjuta will know all the tags availably in these opened file(s).
<p>
<b><u>Project mode operation:<u></b><p>
If there is a project opened, then instead of scanning for tags only in the currently 
opened  files, anjuta will scan all the source and header files of the project. This way 
it is possible to go to any function definition, structure definition, class definition etc. 
without even opening the file. You don't even have to know in which file that tag is 
located (except in function definitions).

<p>
Moreover, you don't have to worry about the synchronization and update of the tag 
database. Anjuta will take care of everything. You just have to tell where you want to go, 
and loo... you are there.
<p>
<b><u>Goto line number:<u></b><p>
You can also go to a particular line number in the current document. Enter 
the line number in the <b>line number entry box</b> in the main tool-bar and pressing Enter. 
Or activate the menu item Edit/Goto Line no..., enter the line number and click OK.
<p>
Life can't be more simpler than this :).
<p>
<b><u>Things to note:<u></b><p>
You should have installed ctags to use this facility. Read the <a href="man:ctags">man page
for ctags</a> for detailed information.
<p>
The tags image recorded is with accordance to the files in the <b>disk</b> and not 
with the buffers anjuta manages for these files. Hence, to keep the tags image up to 
date, the files should be saved regularly. [ you can enable auto save with small 
timer interval ].
