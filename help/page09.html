<h3><u>Compiling and building programs</u></h3>
<p>
Once you have written a C/C++ program you would like to build and run it. 
To compile the current file (it should be a c/c++ source file), click the compile button 
in the extended tool-bar or activate the menu item Build/Compile or press F9. The 
message window will appear and list all the messages including any compilation 
error. You can double click on the error lines (they are red colored) to go to that particular 
line where the error is. You can 
<a href="page14.html#start">define macros</a>, 
<a href="page12.html#start">specify include paths</a> and set the 
<a href="page11.html#start">compiler options</a> if you so wish. 
Compiling a file will save your file first and then compile.
<p>
Compiling a file does not build an executable. It simply generators an object (*.obj) file 
which is later linked to build the executable. 
<p>
So, to build a file, click the build button in the extended tool-bar or activate the menu item 
Build/Build or press F10. This will again display the message window listing all the 
messages that are encountered during the build. The build process will link your object 
file with libraries and generate the executable (of course, on a successful build only). 
You can specify the libraries to link with your file in 
<a href="page13.html#start">compiler options/libraries</a>.
<p>
Remember, the build process will compile your file first if the object file is not up to date 
or it has not yet been generated. That means, you can directly build a file without 
first compiling it. It doesn't make sense to put in a separate step which is automatically 
taken care of. However when you are dealing with a project rather then a single file, you will 
discover that compiling and building a project are entirely two different birds.
