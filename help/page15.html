<h3><u>Specifying supports for your program:</u></h3><p>
You have have seen in the previous sections how to specify the basic compiling 
options ( <i>i.e.. includes, library paths, libraries and defines</i>). This process is 
a cumbersome when you want to use some of the standard ( meaning popular ) libraries 
(Such as gtk libraries, gnome libraries etc. Also it may lead to inconsistencies when you 
distribute your project. To facilitate easy implementation of these libraries and to avoid 
inconsistencies, the developers of such libraries usually supply  a configuration 
program (usually called *-config) along with their libraries.<p>
Well, that's the theory part. Now the practical part. You don't have to bother 
about the library config programs. Anjuta will do the difficult parts for you. 
You just have to mention the particular <b>support</b> you want to use for 
your project.<p>
<b><u>Specifying support:<u></b><p>
Activate the menu item <b>'Settings/Compiler options'</b> and Select the <b>'Supports'</b> 
page in the settings dialog box.<pre>
</pre>Select the support you want to add to your program.<pre>
</pre>
Basically, It will automatically set all the include paths and the libraries necessary for 
the required support. You don't need to set the include paths and the libraries manually.<pre>
</pre>
Presently, It has only three supports, namely, glib, gtk and gnome.<pre>
</pre>
I am planning to add more in the coming releases. Till then be 
satisfied with the given three :).<pre>
</pre>

<b><u>Things to note:<u></b><p>
Remember, once you have specified the support, you don't have to 
specify the basic compiler options such as defines, libraries, includes etc. 
Just forget about them. Only for this support, you will <b>not</b> specify the basic 
compiler options. You may need to supply these for the other things you
are using besides the standard supports.
