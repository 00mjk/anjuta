<h3><u>Other compiler options:</u></h3>
Activate the menu item <b>'Settings/Compiler options'</b> and Select the <b>'Others'</b> 
page in the settings dialog box.<pre>
</pre>
The misc options for compiling are set in this page.<pre>
</pre>
The first one is the <b>'Enable Debugging'</b> option. This option tells the compiler 
to add extra debug information (such as symbol table), which are 
necessary for the program debugging. This makes your program a bit 
larger, but that doesn't matters. Does it?<pre>
</pre>
You should enable this option all 
the time during the development of your program. When your 
program is ready for the release, disable this option and build 
your program again. You should clean your project first and then 
build, otherwise, because of automatic dependency check, all files 
may not be built with this option disabled.<pre>
</pre>
Again, do not set the optimization in the previous page with this 
option enabled. Why? Just try it out and find it for yourself :^D.<pre>
</pre>

<p>
The second option <b>'Enable Profiling'</b> is, more or less, 
same as the Debug option, except that, it builds your program 
with profiling information. Profiling is not yet implemented in Anjuta. 
For the time being, you can use <b>gprof</b>, a console based 
profiler. Read the man page for gprof to learn how to profile your 
program. One thing you should note here is that, enabling profile 
in your program will make it run very slowly (It's a nightmare if 
enabled in X programs).<pre>
</pre>
The third option is very obvious. It will <b>show warnings as errors</b>. 
Put this on if you are very strict with compiler warnings.<pre>
</pre>
Lastly, you can put any other additional compiler options in the entry box marked as 
<b>'Other options'</b> which are not handled by Anjuta. I don't think you 
will ever come to need this. Only for the sake of flexibility, it has been 
added there.
