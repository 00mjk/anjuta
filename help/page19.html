<h3><u>Concept of Project management:</u></h3>
If the program you are developing is a small one and it is going to be run on your
computer only, then a single source file will serve the propose. But if the program is 
a complex one with multiple source files, you need special tools to keep track of 
your program and its resources. Such a <b>program</b> is no longer called a program. It is
called a <b>project</b>.
<p>
Many command line tools are available to maintain and manage a project. And each 
tool is very specific about there operations. Now, I am not going to give you the details of 
what these tools are used for or what these tools do, because now you don't have to worry 
about any of them. Anjuta will take care of everything. If you want to do something of your own 
besides what anjuta does for you (because you think the old good command line options 
has no match :-)), then nobody will stop you. In fact you will have the added advantage of 
making your project more flexible and more adaptable (and more dirty too :-)). 
<p>
But before you jump and start editing all those makefiles, keep in mind the files that Anjuta 
manages. These files are all overwritten.
<p>
Those, who are not dare devils, can just relax and let Anjuta do all (eh.. most) of the stuffs.
<p>
Following are the operations performed on a project:
