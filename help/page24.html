<h3><u>Managing Project files:</u></h3>
<p>
This part is for the <b>dare devils</b>. Others may skip this section.
<p>
Anjuta will manage the following files of a project:
<ol>
  <li> Project file -----------> [ *.prj file in the top project directory ]
  <li> Source Makefile.am -------> [ Makefile.am in the source sub-directory ]
  <li> Document Makefile.am -----> [ Makefile.am in the document sub-directory ]
  <li> POTFILE.in-----------> [ POTFILE.in the po sub-directory ]
</ol>
<p>
If you are doing your own stuffs with the project's build files, then make sure whatever you do
does not conflict with what Anjuta does.
<p>
For that matter, It is better not to touch the build files in the following directories:
<ol>
  <li> source directory
  <li> Document directory
  <li> Pixmap directory
  <li> po directory
</ol>
<p>
Of course, you can add or remove files in these directories. For the first three 
directories, you can let Anjuta do the adding or removing, but for the po 
directory, you have to manually copy the translation file inside. Remember, removing 
a file means removing from the project. The file still exists in the directory. 
You have to delete it manually (or add it later, if you so wish).
<p>
You can also create your own subdirectories in the project. Managing build 
files in these directories is solely your job.
<p>
If your project has multiple executables, then do not mix them with 
the project's main executable in the source directory. Make separate directory 
or directories for them. Again it's your job to manage them.
<p>
Also make sure to update the top level Makefile.am to accommodate the 
subdirectories you have created. Anjuta does not overwrite the top 
level Makefile.am (at least not now).
