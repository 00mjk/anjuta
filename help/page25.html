<h3><u>Compiling, building and executing project:</u></h3>
<p>
<b><u>The basics:<u></b><p>
Executable of a project is generated in two steps:
<ol>
  <li> Compiling
  <li> Linking
</ol>
<p>
These steps collectively is called <i>Building executable</i>. Generally, some other not-so-obvious steps 
may also involve in the build process, but for the shake of simplicity , we 
shall consider only the above two steps.
<p>
<i>Compiling</i> is the step in which so called object files are generated from their corresponding 
source files. For instance, a source file helloc.c, after compilation, will generate hello.o. Basically 
you don't worry about these object files. Just consider them as an intermediate step involved in 
generating the final executable.
<p>
Once the object files (*.o files) are ready, they are all linked together ( along with the libraries ) 
with a linker (a program that links) to generate the final executable. Obviously, this step is 
called <i>Linking</i>.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<b><u>Compiling:<u></b><p>
In a project, the individual files can be compiled separately into object files (*.o files). As I have 
already told, you don't have to worry about these object files, but sometimes it becomes handy 
to compile the file first (especially, to make sure there is no syntax error). Building the whole 
project takes lots of time, especially, for large projects. Therefore, you will be doing lots of
edit-compile-edit-compile-.... while developing the project.
<p>
To compile a file, activate the menu item <b>Build->Compile</b> or click the compile icon in 
the extended tool-bar. This will compile the currently active file.
<p>
<li>
<b><u>Building executable:<u></b><p>
There is no separate link command with Anjuta, simply because it is not necessary. The build 
process will compile all the source files and link them together along with the libraries. Of course, 
build command won't recompile those files which are up to date (This is called dependency check). 
Naturally, if you have compiled all the files individually, then the only thing build does is linking. 
Even this linking will be skipped, if you have already built the project and no dependent file has been 
modified.
<p>
So how exactly does the dependency check influence the project development? 
If you have modified a file, then all the source files that depends on this modified file are recompiled.
Conversely and to be more specific, any file (not only the object files and executable) in the 
project is check for dependency during the build process. If it is found that this file is 
dependent on some other file which has been modified, this particular file will be re-generated.
<p>
Now, since you have got a rough idea about the dependency check, can you imagine 
how your life (as a programmer) would be if there had been no dependency check? 
If you cannot answer this question, then will know the answer when you start developing big 
projects.
<p>
<li>
<b><u>Build and Build all:<u></b><p>
<i>Build</i> will build in the source directory (to generate the executable). 
While <i>Build all</i> will build the whole project. All the subdirectories, including 
the source directory, are recursively built.
<p>
To build the executable, activate the menu item <b>Build->Build</b>. And to Build 
all, activate the menu item, <b>Build->Build All</b>.
<p>
<li>
<b><u>Build Distribution:<u></b><p>
<i>Build distribution</i> will build a distribution tarball package ( *.tar.gz) and put it in the 
top level project directory. Copy the source tarball from there to a save place for distribution.
To build the tarball distribution of the project activate <b>Build->Build Distribution</b>.
<p>
<li>
<b><u>Install:<u></b><p>
Activating the menu item <b>Build->Install</b> will install the project in your computer. 
Note: You must be logged in as root to do system install. Also note that for a gnome 
application to use the pixmaps in the project, it must be system installed. Otherwise, 
when you execute the gnome program ( in your project ), you will get lots of "Pixmaps
not found" errors.
<p>
<li>
<b><u>Configure:<u></b><p>
Activating <b>Build->configure</b> will run the <i>configure</i> script found in the 
top level project directory. Configure script will determine the system configuration
of your system and create some build files (such as Makefiles and config.h). This is
necessary, because your program may depend on some of these configurations.
Unless and until you run <i>configure</i>, you can not start building the project.
<p>
Configure script is, usually, run only once at the beginning of the first build process,
for example, just after you have un-tared a source tarball of a project distribution.
After that, configuration is automatically handled by the subsequent build processes.
If you have used the <i>Application wizard</i> to create the application, then
you won't need to run the configure yourself. The wizard will run it as a part of its
project generation process.
<p>
You can also supply additional options to the configuration script when your are
prompted for them. Just after activating the configure menu item, you will be
prompted with a dialog box shown below:
<p>
<img src="configure_dlg.jpg">
<p>
Enter the options (or leave it blank to go for the defaults) and <i>click OK</i>.
To know what are the available options for the configure script, type <i>"--help"</i>
in the option entry box and <i>click OK</i>. You will get the required help in the
<a href="page01.html#message_win">message window</a>.
<p>
It is not necessary that you should run configure only once. You can run it any time,
usually when you need to change the configuration options. One thing you must note
is that, if you have modified the config.h file in the top level directory, running configure
again won't overwrite it.
<p>
<li>
<b><u>Auto-generation:<u></b><p>
The name is slightly superfluous. But that is almost what it is.
Auto generation consists of two steps, running <i>automake</i> and then running <i>autoconf</i>.
If an executable <i>autogen.sh</i> is found in the top level project directory, this file will be executed
in lieu of the above two steps.
Like <i>configuration</i>, autogeneration is automatically handled by the build process. But you
can always run it when you find it difficult to configure the project (lots of errors coming out 
because of mis-synchronization after modifying lots of build files). One more thing with
autogeneration, unlike configuration, you don't need to run it even once. In fact, you don't 
need to run it at all. I don't know why I put it there, but sometimes it becomes handy.
<p>
Activate the menu item <b>Build->Auto generate</b> to auto generate the project.
<p>
Read the Info pages of <a href="info:automake">Automake</a> and <a href="info:autoconf">
Autoconf</a> for more details on how these work.
<p>
<li>
<b><u>Clean:<u></b><p>
There isn't much to say about <i>Clean</i>. It cleans the project and leave the project
in a state that needs <i>Build All</i> to be performed. It deletes all the files generated
by the build all process, including all the object files (*.o files) and the executable(s) in the
source directory (and other directories). You need to run <i>Build All</i> after you clean your project.
<p>
Activate <b>Build->Clean</b> to clean the project.
<p>
<li>
<b><u>Clean All:<u></b><p>
Similarly, there isn't much to say about <i>Clean all</i> (also called <i>Clean distribution</i>
or <i>clean dist</i>, in short). It cleans the project and leave the project
in a state that needs <i>Configure and Build All</i> to be performed. It deletes all
the files generated by the <i>Configure and Build all</i> processes, including all the
object files (*.o files), executable(s) and Makefiles. In the other words, it leaves
the project as though it has just been un-tared from the distribution tarball (hence, the
name <i>Clean dist</i>).
You need to run <i>Configure and Build All</i>, in the given sequence, after you do
<i>Clean all</i> to the project.
<p>
Activate <b>Build->Clean All</b> to clean all the project.
