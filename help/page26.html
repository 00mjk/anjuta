<h2><u>Debugging:</u></h2><p>
<i>To debug is human. To fix it is divine</i>
<p>
Well, the <i>human</i> part is what I am going to deal here. The <i>Divine</i> part is yours.
When a program does not behave according to what it is suppose to, we say the program
contains bug or bugs. By bugs we don't mean the compilation errors. The compilation errors
are simply errors and they are relatively easier to clear (because compiler tells you where
they are). On the other hand, <i>Bugs</i> refer to those errors that happen during the execution
of the program and they are hard, sometimes very hard, to detect.
<p>
Any program that you think is bug-free is never always bug-free. What we try to do is reduce the
number of bugs contained in the program. The process of removing bugs is, therefore, called
<i>Debugging</i>. And the tool that is used for debugging is called <i>Debugger</i>. Anjuta
provides a very user friendly and powerful debugging environment (actually, a GUI wrapping
over Gdb, a powerful command line debugging tool).
<p>
A debugger tracks and traces the execution of the program and provides you the
various information needed to study the execution of the program.
<p>
<b><u>Debugger Targets:<u></b><p>
Before we actually start debugging, let me briefly summarize what the debugging targets
are. Debugging targets refer to those entities that the debugger interacts during its
operation. There are four types debugging targets. Namely:
<ol>
<li> Executable
<li> Symbol table
<li> Core file
<li> Process
</ol>
<p>
There can be, at most, only one target active for each of the four types of targets at
any give time instance.
All the targets may not be necessarily active for the debugger to work. But there
are certain combinations of the above targets which are required to be active
for a meaningful debugging session. Such as the combination of [ <i>executable, symbol table, and Process</i> ]
or [ <i>executable, symbol-table and core-file</i> ].
<p>
The target <i>Executable</i> become active when you load an executable file into the debugger.
<p>
The target <i>Symbol table</i> is automatically loaded from the executable file, therefore you don't
need to worry about it. The symbol table is necessary for the debugger to identify the
various symbols in the source code of the program. The information is included into
the executable during the compilation (You need to compile
the program with the debug option enabled. See <a>Setting Compiler
options</a> for details).
<p>
The target <i>Core file</i> becomes active when you load the core file into the debugger.
Core file is the memory image of the program which was core-dumped by the
kernel, usually because it had performed an illegal operation. The core file
can give various information such as variable contents, register values, stack trace etc
of the program at the time of core-dump. By studying the core file you can easily know
which part of the program has misbehaved resulting in core-dump.
<p>
The target <i>Process</i> becomes active when you execute the program
under the debugger or when you attach to an already running process.
<p>

<b><u>Starting and Stopping Debugger:<u></b><p>
To start the debugger, activate <b>Debug->Start Debugger</b>. This will start the
debugger with the executable of the currently opened project. If there is no project
opened, then it will load the executable of the currently active file. Otherwise, if
there is neither a project opened or a file opened, then it won't load any executable,
though the debugger will be started. You will have to load the executable yourself
(see the next part: Loading executable).
<p>
Once the debugger is started, you will enter into debugging session. When you are
done with the debugging session, you can exit the debugger by activating
<b>Debug->Stop Debugger</b>.
<p>
<a name="load_exec"></a>
<b><u>Loading executable:<u></b><p>
As mentioned above, debugger will automatically load the executable, if you
have a project or a file opened. Later, if you want to load a different executable,
activate the menu item <b>Debug->Load Executable</b>. A file selection dialog box
will appear. Select the executable you want to debug and click OK.
<p>
<a name="load_core"></a>
<b><u>Loading Core file:<u></b><p>
Activate <b>Debug->Load Core file</b> to load the core file. Select the core file
in the file selection dialog box and click OK. When you load the core file, make sure
you have already loaded its executable file (and hence the symbol table). Otherwise,
you won't feel happy while debugging.
<p>
If you get lots of question marks (??) during the debugging session, then the
core file you have just loaded and the executable aren't matching.
<p>
<a name="attach_detach"></a>
<b><u>Attaching and detaching a process:<u></b><p>
You can attach to an already running process for debugging. Activate
<b>Debug->Attach to Process</b>. You will be given a list of all the
process running on your computer. Select the process you want to attach to
and click OK. In this case also make sure you have first loaded the executable
(and hence the symbol table) into the debugger.
<p>
If you get lots of question marks (??) during the debugging session, then the
process you are attaching to and the executable aren't matching.
