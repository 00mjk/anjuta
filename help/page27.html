<h2><u>Breakpoints:</u></h2><p>
While you are debugging a program you would like to break the execution of the program at
some location, probably because you want to study the state of the execution at that location.
Breakpoints are what that come into picture. You set breakpoints at different locations in your
source file and let the program run. When it encounters any breakpoint, it will suspend the
execution of the program. You can then do whatever you want, such as evaluate expressions,
inspect variables, study the stack trace etc at that location.
<p><img src="brk_dlg.jpg"><p>
By <i>Location</i>, I mean the location of the code in your source file. You will be frequently
prompted for locations. <i>Location</i> can be specified in any of the following formats:
<ul>
<li> File_name:Line_number
<li> Function_name
<li> File:Function_name
</ul>
<p>
The first one is very obvious. The location refers to the line number "Line_number" in the
source file "File". The second one refers to the first line of the function "Function_name".
The third one is similar to the second one except that it is used when you have more than
one function with the name "Function_name" in your program. You differentiate them by
giving "File" which will refer to the function "Function_name" in the file "File".
<p>
With every breakpoint, You may associate two parameters. They are:
<ol>
<li> Break condition
<li> Pass count
</ol>
<p>
The <i>Break condition</i> is a valid C expression which should evaluate to a boolean data. That is
The evaluation of the expression should result in either TRUE(1) or FALSE(0). If the final evaluation
value is not a boolean data, then it will be appropriately type casted to boolean data.
<p>
Every time the breakpoint is encountered during the execution, the break condition will be evaluated.
The debugger will break the execution only if the evaluation results in a TRUE value, otherwise
it will continue the execution as though there had been no breakpoint.
<p>
The <i>pass count</i> is an integer (unsigned) value which tells the debugger to skip the 
breakpoint that many times before it is considered. Pass count has higher priority than the
break condition. Only when the pass count reaches zero will the debugger evaluate the break
condition (if it is present). If there is no break condition, the debugger will break the execution
on pass count zero.
<p>
The default value of Break condition is always TRUE. That is the debugger will break the
execution at the breakpoint location.
<p>
The default value of the Pass count is zero. That is the breakpoint will be considered
on its first encounter itself.

<b><u>Setting breakpoint:<u></b><p>
Bring up the 'Breakpoints editing window' by activating <b>View->Breakpoints</b>
or <b>Debug->Breakpoints->Breakpoints</b>. Click <b>Add</b> button. A breakpoint add
dialog box will appear (as shown below).
<p><img src="brk_add.jpg"><p>
Enter the location
where you want to set the breakpoint. Optionally, you may also enter the <i>Break condition</i>
and the <i>Pass count</i> in the appropriate entry boxes. Click OK to set the breakpoint.
<p>
Alternatively, you may also set the breakpoint by highlighting the function name in the editor
and activating <b>Debug->Breakpoints->Set Breakpoint</b> ( or clicking the Set breakpoint
icon on the <a href="page01.html#start">Debug Toolbar</a>).
<p>
<a name="edit"></a>
<b><u>Editing breakpoint:<u></b><p>
Bring up the 'Breakpoints editing window' by activating <b>View->Breakpoints</b>
or <b>Debug->Breakpoints->Breakpoints</b>. Select the breakpoint you want to edit and
Click <b>Edit</b> button. A breakpoint edit dialog box will appear (as shown below).
<p><img src="brk_add.jpg"><p>
Edit the entries according to your new settings and click OK to
commit the changes.
<p>
<a name="delete"></a>
<b><u>Deleting breakpoint:<u></b><p>
Bring up the 'Breakpoints editing window' by activating <b>View->Breakpoints</b>
or <b>Debug->Breakpoints->Breakpoints</b>. Select the breakpoint you want to 
delete and Click <b>Delete</b> button. This will delete the breakpoint.
<p>
If you want to <i>delete all</i> the breakpoints, then click <b>Delete All</b>.
<p>
<a name="enable"></a>
<b><u>Enabling and disabling breakpoint:<u></b><p>
Bring up the 'Breakpoints editing window' by activating <b>View->Breakpoints</b>
or <b>Debug->Breakpoints->Breakpoints</b>. Select the breakpoint you want to 
enable or disable and Click <b>Toggle Enable</b> button. This will enable or
disable the breakpoint.
<p>
If you want to <i>enable all or disable All</i> breakpoints, instead of clicking
<b>Toggle Enable</b> button, click <b>Enable All</b> or <b>Disable All</b>
button
<p>
<b><u>Things to note:<u></b><p>
When you start the debugger, all the breakpoints will be set. Those breakpoints
which are old (i.e.. the source file is more recent than the breakpoint), will be
disabled.
