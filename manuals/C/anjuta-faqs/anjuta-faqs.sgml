     <question>
      <para>
      What does the name <citetitle>Anjuta</citetitle> stand for? It does 
      not look like one of those recursive names
      </para>
     </question>
     <answer>
      <para>
      It stands for nothing. Naba Kumar started writing <application>Anjuta</application>, 
      and named it after his girlfriend &mdash; this software is dedicated to her.

   <qandaentry>
    <question>
     <para>
     Where can I find the latest source for <application>Anjuta</application>? There is 
     no CVS repository on the project page at SourceForge!
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
     That is because <application>Anjuta</application> is a GNOME application, and is 
	 in <ulink type="http" url="http://cvs.gnome.org">GNOME CVS</ulink>. You can find 
	 out more about how to obtain the CVS sources at the GNOME site, or at the 
     <ulink type="http" url="http://anjuta.sourceforge.net">project home page</ulink>.
     </para>
    </answer>
   </qandaentry> 

    <qandaentry>
     <question>
      <para>
      When I build the <application>Anjuta</application> source, I get compiler errors 
	  for some missing header files / missing library / etc.
      </para>
     </question>
     <answer>
      <para>
      The missing header files probably belong to the GNOME libraries. You may have 
      an old version of the GNOME libraries (<filename>libgnome</filename> and 
      <filename>libgnomeui</filename>). You should upgrade to gnome-libs-1.0.55 or 
      better (<application>Anjuta</application> is currently developed using 
      gnome-1.0.55-12, so you should consider above) and rebuild the source
      </para>
      </answer>
     </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
     <question>
      <para>
      When I try to build <application>Anjuta</application> from source, 
	  <application>make</application> fails in the <filename class="directory">intl</filename> 
	  directory. 
      </para>
     </question>
     <answer>
      <para>
      Look at the output from <application>configure</application>. There may be 
	  errors like:
	  <screen>
      checking for xgettext... (cached) /usr/bin/xgettext
      checking for catalogs to be installed...  es fr it ja pl ru sv tr uk
      sed: can't read ./intl/po2tbl.sed.in: No such file or directory
      creating ./config.status
      creating Makefile
      creating intl/Makefile
      sed: can't read ./intl/Makefile.in: No such file or directory
      creating po/Makefile.in
      </screen>
	  This means that the build failure is probably due to the infamous 
	  <application>gettext</application> bug. This sometimes causes the files required 
	  to build message translations to be destroyed (note: this is not an 
	  <application>Anjuta</application> issue!). You should reinstall 
	  <application>gettext</application>.

   <!-- ============= Installation =========== -->
   <qandadiv>
    <title>Installing <application>Anjuta</application></title>
 
    <qandaentry>
     <question>
      <para>
      Can I install <application>Anjuta</application> locally, in my home directory?
      </para>
     </question>
     <answer>
      <para>
      It is best to do a system installation (as root) and not local installation. 
      <application>Anjuta</application> depends on GNOME for supplying pixmaps, and 
      the help system works with <application>gnome-help-browser</application> 
      or <application>Nautilus</application>, none of which will be happy if you do a 
      local installation.
      </para>

    <qandaentry>
     <question>
      <para>
      I want to help to develop <application>Anjuta</application> &mdash; where can 
	  I find out what tasks need to be done?
      </para>
     </question>
     <answer>
      <para>
      Check the Project page at SourceForge. There are always plenty of bugs and feature 
	  requests to pick up.
