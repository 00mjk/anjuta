    <qandaentry>
     <question>
      <para>
      What does the name <citetitle>Anjuta</citetitle> stand for? It does 
      not look like one of those recursive names
      </para>
     </question>
     <answer>
      <para>
      It stands for nothing. Naba Kumar started writing <application>Anjuta</application>, 
      and named it after his girlfriend &mdash; this software is dedicated to her.

    <qandaentry>
     <question>
      <para>
      Is here/will there ever be <citetitle>Anjuta</citetitle> for Windows ?
      </para>
     </question>
     <answer>
      <para>
		No, unless GNOME itself is ported to Windows first. Anjuta depends a lot on features
		provided by GNOME and UNIX.
     </para>
      </answer>
     </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
     <question>
      <para>
      How about a GNOME2 version of <citetitle>Anjuta</citetitle> ?
      </para>
     </question>
     <answer>
      <para>
	  A GNOME2 port was started but it has stagnated due to lack of interest.
	  Besides, there is already Anjuta2 (a completely different project) which
	  works on GNOME2. However, the Anjuta development team welcomes any effort
	  to port Anjuta to GNOME2.

   <qandaentry>
    <question>
     <para>
     Where can I find the latest source for <application>Anjuta</application>? There is 
     no CVS repository on the project page at SourceForge!
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
     That is because <application>Anjuta</application> is a GNOME application, and is 
	 in <ulink type="http" url="http://cvs.gnome.org">GNOME CVS</ulink>. You can find 
	 out more about how to obtain the CVS sources at the GNOME site, or at the 
     <ulink type="http" url="http://anjuta.org/">project home page</ulink>.
     </para>

   <qandaentry>
    <question>
     <para>
	I don't have CVS access - how do I access the latest Anjuta source ?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
	Latest nightly tarballs of Anjuta are available 
	<ulink type="http" url="http://anjuta.org/cvs/">here</ulink>.
	You should download the ANJUTA_1_0_0 branch sources since HEAD is currently
	unstable and will probably not build.
     </para>
    </answer>
   </qandaentry> 

   <qandaentry>
    <question>
     <para>
	There is no configure script in CVS version !
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
	You'll have to generate the configure script using the autogen.sh script that
	is included with the distribution. Note that you will need compatible versions of
	automake, autoconf and libtool.
     </para>

    <qandaentry>
     <question>
      <para>
      When I build the <application>Anjuta</application> source, I get compiler errors 
	  for some missing header files / missing library / etc.
      </para>
     </question>
     <answer>
      <para>
      The missing header files probably belong to the GNOME libraries. You may have 
      an old version of the GNOME libraries. You should upgrade to a full GNOME 1.4
	  installation. <ulink url="http://www.ximian.com/" type="http">Ximian</ulink>
	  provides pre-built packages for many Linux distributions.
      </para>
      </answer>
     </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
     <question>
      <para>
		I can't compile <application>Anjuta</application> - complains about missing
		package. But I have the package RPMs installed.
      </para>
     </question>
     <answer>
      <para>
		If you want to compile Anjuta from source tarballs/CVS, you'll need the devel
		versions of the packages as well. For example, Anjuta requires gnome-print. So,
		you'll need to install gnome-print as well as gnome-print-devel.
      </para>
      </answer>
     </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
     <question>
      <para>
      When I try to build <application>Anjuta</application> from source, 
	  <application>make</application> fails in the <filename class="directory">intl</filename> 
	  directory.
      </para>
     </question>
     <answer>
      <para>
      Look at the output from <application>configure</application>. There may be 
	  errors like:
	  <screen>
      checking for xgettext... (cached) /usr/bin/xgettext
      checking for catalogs to be installed...  es fr it ja pl ru sv tr uk
      sed: can't read ./intl/po2tbl.sed.in: No such file or directory
      creating ./config.status
      creating Makefile
      creating intl/Makefile
      sed: can't read ./intl/Makefile.in: No such file or directory
      creating po/Makefile.in
      </screen>
	  This means that the build failure is probably due to the infamous 
	  <application>gettext</application> bug. This sometimes causes the files required 
	  to build message translations to be destroyed (note: this is not an 
	  <application>Anjuta</application> issue!). You should reinstall 
	  <application>gettext</application> or use a working version. version 0.10.x
	  if known to work well.

   <!-- ============= Installation =========== -->
   <qandadiv>
    <title>Installing <application>Anjuta</application></title>
 
    <qandaentry>
     <question>
      <para>
      Can I install <application>Anjuta</application> locally, in my home directory?
      </para>
     </question>
     <answer>
      <para>
      It is best to do a system installation (as root) and not local installation. 
      <application>Anjuta</application> depends on GNOME for supplying pixmaps, and 
      the help system works with <application>gnome-help-browser</application> 
      or <application>Nautilus</application>, none of which will be happy if you do a 
      local installation.
      </para>
	  <para>
	  Having said that, Anjuta mostly works fine from a local installtion and Anjuta
	  hackers do it all the time. You might experience some problems with the Help
	  entries, but that's about it. If you encounter such a problem (missing Help
	  entries), install the stable version in the GNOME install prefix and then
	  install the latest version in a local directory.
	  </para>
      </answer>
     </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
     <question>
      <para>
		Installation hangs while executing create_global_tags.sh.
      </para>
     </question>
     <answer>
      <para>
		This is a known problem with some distributions. Basically, there is a recursive
		include loop in some of the files Anjuta is trying to parse. You'll have to manually
		identify and fix the loop, or create a dummy system.tags file.
	  </para>
      </answer>
     </qandaentry>

    <qandaentry>
     <question>
      <para>
		I get lots of jade errors while building documentation.
      </para>
     </question>
     <answer>
      <para>
		You probably do not have updated Docbook stylesheets and/or OpenJade. You can ignore
		the errors since Anjuta will install fine even if the documentation could not be built.

     <answer>
      <para>
      Because you haven't added them ? This is free software. You are free to, even encouraged
	  to take the source code and add the features you need. If you don't think yourself to

     <para>
		Why doesn't Anjuta compile/work on my favourite platform ?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>

      <para>
      Check the <ulink url="http://sf.net/projects/anjuta/" type="http">Project Page</ulink>
	  at SourceForge. There are always plenty of bugs and feature requests to pick up.

      <para>
      If you want to improve Anjuta's editor, it is beter to hack on
	  <ulink url="http://www.scintilla.org/" type="http">Scintilla</ulink> instead.
	  Anjuta simply uses the Scintilla editor widget with some minor changes.

      <para>
      I am a hacker - should I start with Anjuta or Anjuta2 ?
      </para>
     </question>
     <answer>
      <para>
		Start with Anjuta2. You will need a full GNOME2 installation. Asking quesitons
		on gnome-devtools list is a good way to start. Currently, Anjuta2 is
		missing lots of Anjuta features. A good way to get involved is to port
		you favourite missing feature from Anjuta to Anjuta2.

      <para>
		Send it to the developer's mailing list. It is a good idea to subscribe to the

     <para>
		 What is the correct way of including the GTk header files in my applications ?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
		It depends on the GTK verion you are using. If you are using GTK 1.x, you should add
		the output of 'gtk-config --cflags' to your compiler flags. If you are using GTK 2.x,
		you'll need to use the command 'pkg-config --cflags gtk-2.0' instead.

    <answer>
     <para>
		In general, to link against any external library which has a name lib[name].a or

		How do I add multiple build targets/modules/subdirectories?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
		 First create the new sub-directory and and fill it with your own
		 Makefile.am and other source files. Decide if you want to build
		 this directory before the src/ module or after it. If the targets in
		 your sub-directory depend on the target in src/ directory, you should build
		 your directory before the src/ directory, otherwise you can build it after the src/
		 directory.
		 </para>
		 <para>
		 Then go to
		 <menuchoice><guimenu>Project</guimenu><guisubmenu>Project Configuration
		 </guisubmenu><guimenuitem>Modules</guimenuitem></menuchoice> and add the
		 directory in the appropriate entry box. All the directory names should
		 be space separated in these entries. Also, add your module in only of
		 the two entry boxes. lastly, save the project and run autogeneration from 
		 the Build menu.
		</para>
		<para>
		Remember, you are responsible for maintaining the files in these
		 extra sub-directories. A future version of Anjuta will have better
		 GUI support for projects with multiple directories and targets.

     <para>
		Loading is very slow on large projects.

		This is probably due to the symbol browser. You can increase your loading speed
		by turning 'Build Symbol Browser automatically' and 'Update tags image automatically'
		off in Settings->general.
	</para>
     <para>
	 Note that this issue has largely been fixed in the current version of Anjuta
	 so loading time should be tolerable for large projects even with the symbol
	 and file browser building turned on.

		You probably do not have GNU grep installed. GNU grep is required for the Find functionality
		to work corectly. Please install <ulink url="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/" type="http">GNU Grep</ulink>.
	</para>
     <para>
	   Note that it is quite easy to customize your own grep command by adding a
	   new tool using the Tools Editor.

		How do a add files written in a different language to my project ?

    <answer>
     <para>
		You'll have to manually edit your Makefile.am to add the necessary rules. But before that,
		open Project->Configure Project-> Build Files and disable overwriting of Makefile.am so that
		your changes don't get lost.

    <question>
     <para>
		I imported a project using the Project Import feature. Now, when I add source files to the project,
		I find that they no longer compile.
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
		You'll have to manually edit your Makefile.am to add the necessary files. This is because Anjuta is
		currently not smart enough to parse your Makefiles and make the addition of the source files without
		risking damage to your build system.

		I already have a projct tree. How do I use Anjuta ?
    </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
		Use File->Import Project. However, you will have to manage your Makefiles
		manually. A future version of Anjuta will have better project importing
		for Autotools based projects, and hopefully projects of other types as well.

    <question>
     <para>
		I hate the editor fonts/colors/XYZ feature. How do I have better control
		of editor preferences ?
    </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
		Go to Settings->Preferences. You can find most of the editor preferences
		unset the 'Styles' and 'Editor' tabs. However, not all preferences are
		available through the GUI. If you want more control over the editor, open
		$HOME/.anjuta/session.properties, $HOME/.anjuta/user.properties and
		$prefix/share/anjuta/properties/anjuta.properties and edit them by
		hand. Make sure that Anjuta if not running when you do this, however !

    <question>
     <para>
		Should I use Anjuta 1 or Anjuta 2 ?
    </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
	Currently, Anjuta is more usable than Anjuta2. However, most of the development effort is
	concentrated on Anjuta2, so if you're looking for powerful new features, Anjuta2 is the
	likely candidate for implementation. Also, Anjuta2 is a full GNOME2 application while Anjuta
	is dependent on GNOME1 libraries. For long-term investment, Anjuta2 is a better option.
	</para>
	<para>
	Ultimately, it is all about what works best at a particular time for a particular
	scenario for you. You'll need to use both and make an informed decision.
