  <title>Why doesn't <app>Anjuta</app> have my favourite XYZ feature?</title>

  <p>Because you haven't added them ? This is free software. You are free to, even encouraged
  to take the source code and add the features you need. If you don't think yourself to
  be capable of doing that, file a request for enhancement or send a mail to the devel list.</p>
