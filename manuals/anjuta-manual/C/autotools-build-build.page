  <title>Build targets</title>
  <p>
    A target is a file created from source files, typically it is a program
    or a library, but it could be a documentation if some processing is
    needed. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The build command compile all needed sources files and link them
    with possibly some other files, like libraries, in order to create the target.
    If some source files are already compiled and haven't been modified,
    they are not be recompiled to gain time. There are several ways
    to trigger a build.
