  <title>GNU Autotools Project Back end Plugin</title>

  <p>
    This is the most common project format on Linux. It has been designed to
    distribute source code packages on a wide range of Unix like systems.
    If you have already install a program using <cmd>configure</cmd>,
    <cmd>make</cmd> and <cmd>make install</cmd>, you probably have already
    used it as an user.
  </p>

  <p> 
    It is typically a bit more difficult to use as a developer.
    Hopefully, it is the default and the more advanced back end for
    <app>Anjuta</app>. All features of the project manager are enabled
    when using it.
    You should be able to have a project using it without writing a line in
    <file>configure.ac</file> nor any <file>Makefile.am</file> files.
  </p> 

  <note style="bug">
    <p>
      Autotools files give more information than makefile but the back end
      does not support every tricks. If you find a project that
      cannot be read correctly, filling a bug report will be appreciate.
      In the meantime, as a work around, you can use the directory back end
      project instead, it much more limited but should find all source files.
