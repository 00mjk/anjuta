  <application>Anjuta</application> is a versatile Integrated Development Environment 
  (IDE) for C and C++ on GNU/Linux. It has been written for GTK/GNOME, and features 
  a number of advanced programming features. It is basically a GUI interface for the 
  collection of command line programming utilities and tools available for Linux. 
  These are usually run via a text console, and can be unfriendly to use.

  <application>Anjuta</application> is an effort to marry the flexibility and power 
  of text-based command line tools with the ease-of-use of GNOME's graphical user 
  interface. That's why it has been made as user-friendly as possible.
