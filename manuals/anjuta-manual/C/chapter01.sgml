  <title>Introduction to Anjuta</title>
  <para>
   Anjuta is a very versatile Integrated development environment for
   c and c++ (Gnu/Linux). Written in gtk/gnome and written for gtk/gnome,
   it features many advanced programming tools and utilities. It is basically
   a GUI interface for the bunch of command line programming utilities
   and tools available for Linux, which are usually run in console and
   are very un-user friendly.

   Anjuta is an effort to marry the flexibility and power of text
   based command line tools with the ease of graphical user interface
   of gnome.

   Presently, Anjuta is only in Beta release and lots of work are to
   be done to improve it. I hope in the 
   future Anjuta is going to be much more 
   capable and stable. Extensive debugging session
   has not yet been performed.
   So, undoubtedly, it will have lots of bugs. It will be
   my pleasure if you use it and
   report the bugs to us. That way, you will
   be helping to improve the software as well as helping the open-source community.
