    Once your executable is ready after the build, you can execute it by clicking
    the execute button in the extended toolbar or activating the menu item
    Build/execute or pressing F3. Unlike build, execution doesn't check for
    dependency (at least for the time being). That is, it would check if the
    executable is upto date before it executes the program. So, <citetitle>you must take
    care of that yourself.</citetitle>

    If you want to pass any argument(s) to your program, activate <citetitle>Build-&gt;
    Set Program Param...</citetitle> and enter the arguments in the dialog box that
    will appear (shown below) and click Ok. You can also specify if the program
    should be run in terminal or not.
