  <title>Project Management</title>
  
  <para>
   If the program you are developing is a small one and it is going to be run on your
   computer only, then a single source file will serve the propose. But if the program is 
   a complex one with multiple source files, you need special tools to keep track of 
   your program and its resources. Such a <citetitle>program</citetitle> is no
   longer called a program. It is called a <citetitle>project</citetitle>.

   Many command line tools are available to maintain and manage a project. And each 
   tool is very specific about there operations. Now, I am not going to give you the details of 
   what these tools are used for or what these tools do, because now you don't have to worry 
   about any of them. Anjuta will take care of everything. If you want to do something of your own 
   besides what anjuta does for you (because you think the old good command line options 
   has no match :-)), then nobody will stop you. In fact you will have the added advantage of 
   making your project more flexible and more adaptable (and more dirty too :-)). 
  </para>
  
  <para>
   But before you jump and start editing all those makefiles, keep in mind the files that Anjuta 
   manages. These files are all overwritten.
  </para>
  
  <para>
   Those, who are not dare devils, can just relax and let Anjuta do all (eh.. most) of the stuffs.

    language</citetitle> for the initial 
    project generation. Only C and C++ are 
    supported now.
    Also specify if your  
    project will have <citetitle>internationalization support</citetitle> 
    using <citetitle>gettext</citetitle> (Read the
    info page for gettext for more details). This gives your project
    a multi lingual support for different regional languages such as English, French, Dutch etc.
    The rest of the options are self explanatory. <citetitle>Click Next</citetitle> to proceed.

    Once the project creation is over, you can try it out by

   <title>Adding and removing files</title>
   <para>
There are three types of files Anjuta will manage for you in the project. They are:
<p>
<ul>
  <li> Source files
  <li> Document files
  <li> Pixmap files
</ul>
<p>
These three different types of files exist in the three different directories under the project.
Namely, <i>Source directory, Document directory and Pixmap directory</i>
<p>
<b><u>Adding files:<u></b><p>
Activate the corresponding <i>Add</i> menu item from the <b>Project</b> sub-menu. 
Select the file you want to add in the <i>file selection dialog box</i> and <i>click OK</i>. 
<p>
If the file you are adding is already added to the project, then Anjuta will not add it again. 
It will also give you a warning that the file is already added.
<p>
If the file you are adding is not in the <i>corresponding</i> directory (<i>source directory, document directory 
or pixmap directory</i>), then Anjuta will ask you a confirmation to copy the file in the corresponding 
directory. Anjuta can not add a file which is outside the corresponding directory. It needs to 
be copied first to the directory and then added. That's why Anjuta ask for the confirmation.
