  <title>Debugging: Execution</title>
  <para>
   Execution of a program in the debugger can be finely controlled. The program can be 
   executed in single steps, or allowed to continue until it encounters a breakpoint. 
   Executing like this is essential for tracking program behaviour. Like a video editing 
   session, the program can be executed in <emphasis>slow motion</emphasis>
   with the ability to go forward, pause, stop, and so on.
  </para>
  <para>
   The methods that can be used to execute a program in the debugger are described in 
   the next few sections.
  </para>
  
  <sect1 id="dbg-step-in">
   <title>Single stepping (step in)</title>
   <para>
    Single stepping executes only one statement of the program (from the place where it 
	has stopped) and then returns control. If the statement that is executed contains one 
	or more functions, the debugger tries to step inside the functions (in the sequence in 
	which the functions are executed). Once the statement is executed and
    control is passed back, it is possible to study the various program parameters.
   </para>
   <para>
    If the program has not been started at the time single stepping is started, the 
	program will be started and will be stopped at the first statement of the program 
	(the first statement in the function <emphasis>main()</emphasis>).
   </para>
   <para>
    Choose the menu item <menuchoice><guisubmenu>Debug</guisubmenu>
	<guisubmenu>Execution</guisubmenu><guimenuitem>Step In</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
    or click on the <guibutton>Step In</guibutton> icon in the 
	<interface>Debug toolbar</interface> to step into a program.
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="dbg-step-over">
   <title>Single stepping (step over)</title>
   <para>
    <emphasis>Step over</emphasis> is similar to <emphasis>step in</emphasis>,
    except that it does not step inside any function in the statement being executed.
    The statement will be executed in one go.
   </para>
   <para>
    Choose the menu item <menuchoice><guisubmenu>Debug</guisubmenu>
	<guisubmenu>Execution</guisubmenu><guimenuitem>Step Over</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
    or click on the <guibutton>Step Over</guibutton> icon in the 
	<interface>Debug toolbar</interface> to step over statements in a program.
   </para>
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1 id="dbg-step-out">
   <title>Single stepping (step out)</title>
   <para>
    <emphasis>Step out</emphasis> will execute the current function until it 
	returns. The program will be stopped once it exits from the function. 
	Step out is not really single stepping, because it does not only execute 
	a single statement &mdash; it executes the whole function until that 
	function returns to the calling function.
   </para>
   <para>
    Choose the menu item <menuchoice><guisubmenu>Debug</guisubmenu>
	<guisubmenu>Execution</guisubmenu><guimenuitem>Step Out</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
    or click on the <guibutton>Step Out</guibutton> icon in the 
	<interface>Debug toolbar</interface> to step out in a program.
   </para>
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1 id="dbg-run">
   <title>Run/Continue</title>
   <para>
    This option will continue the execution of the program until a breakpoint is 
	encountered, or the program exits.
   </para>
   <para>
    If the program is not yet started, then the program will be started and executed until 
	a breakpoint or program termination is reached.
   </para>
   <para>
    Choose the menu item <menuchoice><guisubmenu>Debug</guisubmenu>
	<guisubmenu>Execution</guisubmenu><guimenuitem>Run/Continue</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
    or click on the <guibutton>Run/Continue</guibutton> icon in the 
	<interface>Debug toolbar</interface> to continue the execution of a program.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1 id="dbg-stop">
   <title>Stop Program</title>
   <para>
    This option will kill the program which is being debugged. Note that it is not
	possible to stop an attached process.
   </para>
   <para>
    Choose the menu item <menuchoice><guisubmenu>Debug</guisubmenu>
	<guimenuitem>Stop Program</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
    or click on the <guibutton>Stop Program</guibutton> icon in the 
	<interface>Debug toolbar</interface> to terminate the execution of a program.
   </para>
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1 id="dbg-restart">
   <title>Restart Program</title>
   <para>
    This option will stop the program and then restart it. All of the 
    breakpoints will remain in effect. Note that it is not possible to restart an
    attached process.
   </para>
   <para>
    Choose the menu item <menuchoice><guisubmenu>Debug</guisubmenu>
	<guimenuitem>Restart Program</guimenuitem></menuchoice> to restart the 
	execution of a program.
   </para>
