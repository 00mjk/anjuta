   <title>Stack Window</title>
   <para>
    Stack trace window shows the contents of the program stack. It will list all the functions and their arguments
    in the sequence they were called. You will also find a number representing each call. This number is
    called <citetitle>Frame</citetitle>. Each call in the trace exists in different frames. It starts from  frame 0 (Last function
    being called) and grows higher as the function nesting become deeper and deeper.
   </para>
   <para>
    Activate <citetitle>View-&gt;Program Stack</citetitle>, to bring up the
    stack trace of the program being debugged.

   <para>
    You will find a small arrow pointing to a frame in the stack trace. This arrow shows the currently
    selected frame. Default is frame 0, the last function being called. All the evaluation and inspection
    of expressions or variables will be with reference to this selected frame. Naturally, the scope of
    the variables or expressions being evaluated will be limited to the selected frame only. The same
    applies for the expressions in the watch.

   <title>Setting the current frame:</title>
   <para>
    Double clicking on any frame in the stack trace will set the frame as currently selected frame (the
    arrow will now point to this frame, indicating that it has been selected as the current frame).
    Alternatively, you can pop-up the operation menu by right clicking on the stack trace window and
    activate the menu item <citetitle>Set frame</citetitle> to set the frame.
   </para>

   <title>Information about the current frame:</title>
   <para>
    You can also get the information about the currently selected frame by activating
    <citetitle>Debug->Information->Info Current frame</citetitle>. A window will
    appear describing the current frame.
