  <title>Directory Project Back end Plugin</title>

  <p>
    This is the simplest project back end. There is no project file. It 
    works like a file viewer considering as source files, all files matching
    some typical source extensions by example <file>.c</file>,
    <file>.py</file>.
    Directories are kept in order to group source files but there is no
    target.
  </p>

  <p>
    This back end is an useful work around if your project has not a
    corresponding back end in <app>Anjuta</app> or if this back end
    does not fully support your project.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is not possible to add or change anything with such project. But
    if you create a source file in the project directory with the
    right extension it will be added automatically.
