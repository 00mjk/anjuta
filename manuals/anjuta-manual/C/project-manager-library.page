    <title>Add a non packaged library in a target</title>

    <p>
      In order to use a library in C, you need to tell to the compiler
      where are the header files and to the linker where are the
      needed libraries. The issue is that your program will not compile
      on another computer if the header and the libraries are elsewhere.
    </p>

    <steps>
      <item>
        <p>
 	  Select the directory containing the program where you want to
          add the library in the <gui>project view</gui>, click on the
          right mouse button to make the <gui>project context menu</gui>
          appear and select <gui>Properties</gui>.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Or from the <gui>main menu</gui>, select <guiseq><gui>Project</gui>
          <gui>Properties</gui></guiseq>. By default, It edits the
          properties of the currently selected item in the project view.
          You can select a different node, by expanding
          <gui>Browse other nodes</gui> and select another one.
        </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>
          If the header files are installed in a standard location
          (<file>/usr/include</file>) you don't have to set this. Else
          you need to add <input>-I<var>include_path</var></input> in
          the <gui>C preprocessor flags</gui> property when using
          <app>gcc</app>. You can add several paths separated with
          space. These options will be used for all targets inside this
          directory.
        </p>
        <p>
          You could have to expand the <gui>More options</gui> to see this.
          Click on <gui>Apply</gui> button when it's done.
        </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>
 	  Select the target where you want to
          add the library in the <gui>project view</gui>, click on the
          right mouse button to make the <gui>project context menu</gui>
          appear and select <gui>Properties</gui>.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Or from the <gui>main menu</gui>, select <guiseq><gui>Project</gui>
          <gui>Properties</gui></guiseq>. By default, It edits the
          properties of the currently selected item in the project view.
          You can select a different node, by expanding
          <gui>Browse other nodes</gui> and select another one.
        </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>
          You need to set the <gui>Linker flags</gui> properties adding
          <input>-l<var>library_name</var></input> for <app>gcc</app>.
          <var>library_name</var> is the name of the library file without the
          <file>lib</file> prefix and without the <file>.a</file> or
          <file>.so</file> extension.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the library is in not in a standard directory, <app>gcc</app>
          can look in additional directories with the option
          <input>-L<var>library_path</var></input>.
        </p>

      <item>
        <p>

          <gui>C preprocessor flags</gui> and <gui>Linker flags</gui>
          properties. Click on <gui>Apply</gui> button to write the
