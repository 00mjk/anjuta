  <title>Create a Module</title>

  <p>On Linux, most libraries are distributed with additional data stored
  in a <app>pkg-config</app> file. This file contains information like
  the other libraries needed, the C compiler and the linker flags needed
  to use that library. This file, the header files and the library files
  themselves is called a package.</p>
 
  <p><app>Anjuta</app> provides an simple interface to use such library.
  If the library you need is not one of these, check the 
  <link xref="project-manager-library-add">Add non-packaged libraries</link>
  page.</p>

  <p>A package cannot be added directly to your program; you first need to
  create a module for it, which is just a group of packages.</p>

  <steps>
    <item>
      <p>Select the program where you want to add the new library in
      the <gui>project view</gui>, click on the right mouse button to
      make the <gui>project context menu</gui> appear, and select
      <gui>Add Library</gui>. Then click on the <gui>New Library</gui>
      button on this dialog.</p>

      <p>Or from the <gui>main menu</gui>, select <guiseq><gui>Project</gui>
      <gui>New Library...</gui></guiseq>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>You will get a list of all the packaged libraries installed on your
      system. You can check one or more libraries.</p>
      <note style="tip">
        <p>If the library you want does not appear here, perhaps it
        is because it is not installed on your system.
        Launch the application you
        use to install new programs and search for the library name.
        The package you need often has a "dev" or "devel" suffix and
        should include header files and a <app>pkg-config</app> file with a
        <file>.pc</file> extension.</p>
      </note>
      <p>After selecting one library, a module name will be
      automatically generated but you can change it. When you are
      done, click on the <gui>Add</gui> button to create the new module
      with the selected libraries.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Read the <link xref="project-manager-module-add">next page</link> to
      find out how to add this new module to your target.</p>
    </item>
  </steps>
