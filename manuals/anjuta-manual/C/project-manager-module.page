  <title>Add or remove new libraries</title>

  <p>
    On Linux, most libraries are packaged to be easily used.
    When you need one of these libraries, <app>Anjuta</app> provides
    an easy interface to add it. If the library you need is not one of these,
    check the <link xref="project-manager-library">Add non-packaged
    libraries</link> page.

    <title>Add packaged libraries in a new module</title>

    <p>
      A library cannot be added directly to your program; you first need to
      create a module for it, which is just a group of libraries.
    </p>

    <steps>
      <item>
        <p>
 	  Select the program where you want to add the new library in
          the <gui>project view</gui>, click on the right mouse button to
          make the <gui>project context menu</gui> appear, and select
          <gui>Add Library</gui>. Then click on the <gui>New Library</gui>
          button on this dialog.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Or from the <gui>main menu</gui>, select <guiseq><gui>Project</gui>
          <gui>New Library...</gui></guiseq>
        </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>
          You will get a list of all the packaged libraries installed on your
          system. You can check one or more libraries. 
        </p>
        <note style="tip">
          <p>
            If the library you want does not appear here, perhaps it
            is because it is not installed on your system.
            Launch the application you
            use to install new programs and search for the library name.
            The package you need often has a "dev" or "devel" suffix and
            should include header files and a pkg-config file with a
            <file>.pc</file> extension.
          </p>
        </note>
        <p>
          After selecting one library, a module name will be
          automatically generated but you can change it. When you are
          done, click on the <gui>Add</gui> button to create the new module
          with the selected libraries.
        </p>
      </item>

        <p>
          Read the <link xref="project-manager-package">next page</link> to
          find out how to add this new module to your target.

    <title>Add packaged libraries in an existing module</title>

    <steps>
      <item>
        <p>
 	  Select the module where you want to add the new library in
          the <gui>project view</gui>, click on the right mouse button to
          make the <gui>project context menu</gui> appear and select
          <gui>New Library</gui>.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Or from the <gui>main menu</gui>, select <guiseq><gui>Project</gui>
          <gui>New Library...</gui></guiseq>
        </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>
          In the list of all packaged libraries, check the additional
          libraries wanted. Check that expected module name is selected
          in the bottom text box.
          Then click on the <gui>Add</gui> button to update the module.
        </p>

        <p>
          Select the library you want to remove in the
          <gui>project view</gui> , click on the right mouse button to
          make the <gui>project context menu</gui> appear and select

        </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>
