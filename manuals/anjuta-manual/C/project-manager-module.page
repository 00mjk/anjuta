  <title>Add or remove new libraries</title>

  <p>
    On Linux, most libraries are packaged to be easily used.
    When you need such library, <app>Anjuta</app> provides
    a easy interface to add it. If not check the Add not
    packaged libraries page.

    <title>Add packaged libraries in a new Module</title>

    <p>
      Such library cannot be added directly to your program you need to first
      create a module for it which is just a group of libraries.
    </p>

    <steps>
      <item>
        <p>
 	  Select the program where you want to add the new library in
          the <gui>project view</gui>, click on the right mouse button to
          make the <gui>project context menu</gui> appear and select
          <gui>Add Library</gui>. Then click on the <gui>New Library</gui>
          button on this dialog.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Or from the <gui>main menu</gui>, select <guiseq><gui>Project</gui>
          <gui>New Library</gui></guiseq>
        </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>
          You will get a list of all packaged libraries installed on your
          system. You can check one or more libraries. 
        </p>
        <note style="tip">
          <p>
            If the library you want does not appear here, perhaps it
            is because it is not installed on your system.
            Launch the application you
            use to install new programs and search for the library name.
            The needed package often have a "dev" or "devel" suffix and
            should include header files and a pkg-config file with a
            <file>.pc</file> extension.
          </p>
        </note>
        <p>
          After selecting a first library, a module name will be
          automatically generated but you can change it. When it is
          done, click on <gui>Add</gui> button to create the new module
          with the selected libraries.
