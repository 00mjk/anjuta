	<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>
		Anjuta is a versatile Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
		for C and C++ on GNU/Linux.  It has been written for GTK/GNOME
		and features a number of advanced programming facilities.
		These include project management, application wizards, an
		on-board interactive debugger, and a powerful source editor
		with source browsing and syntax highlighting.
		</p><p>
		Anjuta is an effort to marry the flexibility and power of text-based
		command-line tools with the ease-of-use of the GNOME graphical user
		interface.  That is why it has been made as user-friendly as possible.
		</p><p>
		Any sort of suggestions or patches for Anjuta are also most welcome.
